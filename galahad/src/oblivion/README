Wecome to Oblivion. This is a repository for protoype
GALAHAD packages that, honestly, didn't make the grade,
or which we ran out of energy, effort or patience to finish.
Most will work to some extent, but we do not believe that
they have met their initial promise. We have cast them into
oblivion as a warning to others. Please feel free to tinker,
but be warned, aside from in-line comments, there is no
propoer documentation.
