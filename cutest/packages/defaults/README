CUTEst packages/defaults README file.			    January 2013

========================================================================

  Please read this file prior to any modification in this directory.

========================================================================

This directory contains a file  for each supported external package that
provides  values   for  the  environment   variables  PACKAGE,  PACKDIR,
PACK_PRECISION, PACKOBJS,  PACKLIBS and SPECS  that are required  by the
CUTEst  script runcutest.  Precise  definitions of  these variables  are
given in  the file ./example. If  a user wishes to  override the default
value for  a particular  package, she should  copy the  relevant package
file  into  the  directory  ../(architecture/(precision)/ and  edit  the
required entries  in the newly-created file. The  runcutest package will
check   $CUTEST/packages/(architecture/(precision)/  in   precedence  to
$CUTEST/packages/defaults/ when assigning environment variables.

========================================================================

			      Good luck!
