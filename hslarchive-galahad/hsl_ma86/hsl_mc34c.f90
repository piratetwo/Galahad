!             Create hsl_mc34_integer
!             Change from logical Hermitian to integer sym_type to cope with
!             skew symmetric matrices as well as Hermitian and symmetric ones.

! to change precision:
!    change _double, kind(0.0d0)
! For complex version:
!    change real to complex
! For Hermitian case, take conjugate for upper triangle entries
! For integer version:
!    change real to integer, kind(0)

      subroutine mc34_expand_complex(n,row,ptr,iw,a,sym_type)

!  this subroutine generates the expanded structure for a
!   matrix a with a symmetric sparsity pattern given the structure 
!   for the lower triangular part.  diagonal entries need not be present.

      integer, intent(in) :: n  ! holds the order of a.

      integer, intent(inout) :: row(*) ! must be set by the user to
!       hold the row indices of the lower triangular part of a.
!       the entries of a single column must be
!       contiguous. the entries of column j must precede those of column
!       j+1, and there must be no wasted space between
!       columns. row indices within a column may be in any order.  on
!       exit, it will have the same meaning but will be changed to hold
!       the row indices of the entries in the expanded structure.  diagonal
!       entries need not be present. the new row indices added in the
!       upper triangular part will be in order for each column and will
!       precede the row indices for the lower triangular part which will
!       remain in the input order.

     integer, intent(inout) ::ptr(n+1)  !  must be set
!       by the user so that ptr(j) is the position in row
!       of the first entry in column j and
!       ptr(n+1) must be set to one more than the total number of
!       entries.  on exit, ptr(j) will have the same meaning but
!       will be changed to point to the position of the first entry of
!       column j in the expanded structure. the new value of
!       ptr(n+1) will be one greater than the number of entries in
!       the expanded structure.

     integer :: iw(n) ! workspace

     complex(wp), optional, intent(inout) :: a(*) 
!       if present, a(1:ptr(n+1)-1) must be set by the user so that
!       a(k) holds the value of the entry in row(k). 
!       on exit, a will hold the values of the entries in the expanded 
!       structure corresponding to the output values of row.

     integer, optional, intent(in) :: sym_type 
!      if present with value 1, matrix is skew symmetric.
!      if present with value 2, matrix is hermitian.
!      otherwise matrix is symmetric.
