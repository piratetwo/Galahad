WHAT IS IPOPT 3.0?
------------------

IPOPT is an implementation of a primal-dual interior point algorithm
for solving Nonlinear Optimization Problems (NLPs) of the form

min    f(x)                   (1)
s.t.   c(x) = 0               (2)
       x_L <= x <= x_U        (3)

The objective function f: R^n ---> R and the equality constraints
c: R^n ---> R^m (m <=n) are assumed to be twice continuously
differentiable and can be nonlinear and nonconvex.  In (3), not all
variables need to have lower and upper bounds.

HOW DO I GET IPOPT?
-------------------

See 

  https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt

USING IPOPT 3.0 WITH CUTEst
--------------------------

Using the makefile found in the 'CUTE_interface' subdirectory, the IPOPT
installation procedure creates the files

        $IPOPT/OBJECTS/IPOPT/CUTEr_interface/libipoptcuter.a, and
	$MYCUTER/double/lib/ipopt.liblist

The first contains relevant gateways between CUTEst and IPOPT while the
second contains all library information corresponding to user settings
within IPOPT, assuming you installed IPOPT 3.0 in the directory $IPOPT.

IPOPT 2.0 is not available in single precision.

USING THE IPOPT 3.0 INTERFACE TOOL
----------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The IPOPT 3.0 interface tools require two input files:

	probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
	ipopt.liblist  contains library information for the linker.

Please refer to the IPOPT 3.0 documentation for more details.

To run with CUTEst, use the runcutest command with the -p ipopt option.
See the man page for runcutest for more details of other options.
