Introduction</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tru_purpose"></a>
Purpose</h2>
<p>The tru package uses a <b>trust-region method to find a (local) unconstrained minimizer of a differentiable objective function \(\mathbf{f(x)}\) of many variables \(\mathbf{x}\).</b> The method offers the choice of direct and iterative solution of the key trust-region subproblems, and is most suitable for large problems. First derivatives are required, and if second derivatives can be calculated, they will be exploited&mdash;if the product of second derivatives with a vector may be found, but not the derivatives themselves, that may also be exploited.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="tru_terminology"></a>
Terminology</h2>
<p>The <em>gradient</em> \(\nabla_x f(x)\) of \(f(x)\) is the vector whose \(i\)-th component is \(\partial f(x)/\partial x_i\). The <em>Hessian</em> \(\nabla_{xx} f(x)\) of \(f(x)\) is the symmetric matrix whose \(i,j\)-th entry is \(\partial^2 f(x)/\partial x_i \partial x_j\). The Hessian is <em>sparse</em> if a significant and useful proportion of the entries are universally zero.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tru_method"></a>
Method</h2>
<p>A trust-region method is used. In this, an improvement to a current estimate of the required minimizer, \(x_k\) is sought by computing a step \(s_k\). The step is chosen to approximately minimize a model \(m_k(s)\) of \(f(x_k + s)\) within a trust region \(\|s_k\| \leq \Delta_k\) for some specified positive "radius" \(\Delta_k\). The quality of the resulting step \(s_k\) is assessed by computing the "ratio" \((f(x_k) - f(x_k + s_k))/ (m_k(0) - m_k(s_k))\). The step is deemed to have succeeded if the ratio exceeds a given \(\eta_s &gt; 0\), and in this case \(x_{k+1} = x_k + s_k\). Otherwise \(x_{k+1} = x_k\), and the radius is reduced by powers of a given reduction factor until it is smaller than \(\|s_k\|\). If the ratio is larger than \(\eta_v \geq \eta_d\), the radius will be increased so that it exceeds \(\|s_k\|\) by a given increase factor. The method will terminate as soon as \(\|\nabla_x f(x_k)\|\) is smaller than a specified value.</p>
<p>Either linear or quadratic models \(m_k(s)\) may be used. The former will be taken as the first two terms \(f(x_k) + s^T \nabla_x f(x_k)\) of a Taylor series about \(x_k\), while the latter uses an approximation to the first three terms \(f(x_k) + s^T \nabla_x f(x_k) + \frac{1}{2} s^T B_k s\), for which \(B_k\) is a symmetric approximation to the Hessian \(\nabla_{xx}f(x_k)\) ; possible approximations include the true Hessian, limited-memory secant and sparsity approximations and a scaled identity matrix. Normally a two-norm trust region will be used, but this may change if preconditioning is employed.</p>
<p>An approximate minimizer of the model within the trust region is found using either a direct approach involving factorization or an iterative (conjugate-gradient/Lanczos) approach based on approximations to the required solution from a so-called Krlov subspace. The direct approach is based on the knowledge that the required solution satisfies the linear system of equations \((B_k + \lambda_k I) s_k = - \nabla_x f(x_k)\) involving a scalar Lagrange multiplier \(\lambda_k\). This multiplier is found by uni-variate root finding, using a safeguarded Newton-like process, by the GALAHAD packages TRS or DPS (depending on the norm chosen). The iterative approach uses the GALAHAD package GLTR, and is best accelerated by preconditioning with good approximations to \(B_k\) using GALAHAD's PSLS. The iterative approach has the advantage that only matrix-vector products \(B_k v\) are required, and thus \(B_k\) is not required explicitly. However when factorizations of \(B_k\) are possible, the direct approach is often more efficient.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="main_symmetric_matrices"></a>
Symmetric matrix storage formats</h1>
<p>The symmetric \(n\) by \(n\) matrix \(H = \nabla_{xx}f\) may be presented and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).</p>
<p>Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed. Choose <code>control.f_indexing</code> as <code>false</code> for C style and <code>true</code> for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version.</p>
<p>Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_dense"></a>
Dense storage format</h2>
<p>The matrix \(H\) is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array. Since \(H\) is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part \(H_{ij}\) for \(0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\)) need be held. In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is component \(i \ast i / 2 + j\) of the storage array H_val will hold the value \(H_{ij}\) (and, by symmetry, \(H_{ji}\)) for \(0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_coordinate"></a>
Sparse co-ordinate storage format</h2>
<p>Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the \(l\)-th entry, \(0 \leq l \leq ne-1\), of \(H\), its row index i, column index j and value \(H_{ij}\), \(0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\), are stored as the \(l\)-th components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as H_ne = \(ne\). Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="symmetric_matrix_row_wise"></a>
Sparse row-wise storage format</h2>
<p>Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1. For the i-th row of \(H\) the i-th component of the integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one. The column indices j, \(0 \leq j \leq i\), and values \(H_{ij}\) of the entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = H_ptr(i), \(\ldots\), H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively. Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor. </p>
