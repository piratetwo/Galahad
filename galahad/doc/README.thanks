Thanks are due to numerous people over the years who have
directly or inderiectly lead to improvements in GALAHAD packages.

Important direct contributions were made by Coralia Cartis 
and Sue Thorne (nee Dollar) from RAL, Daniel Robinson from Oxford
and Margherita Porcelli from Florence.

Less directly, Mario Arioli, Iain Duff, Jonathan Hogg, John Reid
and Jennifer Scott (RAL), Olaf Schenk (U. Basel) and Anshul Gupta (IBM)
have all helped by adding design features to HSL and other sparse matrix 
codes codes to make them usable by GALAHAD packages. Sven Leyffer (Argonne)
and Jorge Nocedal (Northwestern) both made important suggestions that
have resulted in better nonlinear programming solvers.

Specific thanks to N. Shamsundar (Houston) for his line-by-line
analysis of LANCELOT, and his numerous sugestions on how to
avoid difficulties we had overlooked. 

And of course to Andy Conn (IBM) without whom LANCELOT would
have never happened.

Nick, Dominique and Philippe
