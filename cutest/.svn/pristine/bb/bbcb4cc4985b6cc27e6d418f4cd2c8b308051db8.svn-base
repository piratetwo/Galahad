!  return the values of counters maintained by the CUTEst tools. 
!  The counters are:

!    CALLS( 2 ): number of calls to the objective gradient
!    CALLS( 3 ): number of calls to the objective Hessian
!    CALLS( 4 ): number of Hessian times vector products
!    CALLS( 5 ): number of calls to the constraint functions
!    CALLS( 6 ): number of calls to the constraint gradients
!    CALLS( 7 ): number of calls to the constraint Hessians

!    TIME( 1 ): CPU time (in seconds) for CSETUP
!    TIME( 2 ): CPU time (in seconds) since the end of CSETUP

!  Note that each constraint function is counted separately. 
!  Evaluating all the constraints thus results in work%pnc 
!  evaluations, where work%pnc is the number of constraints in
