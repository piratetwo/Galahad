WHAT IS CURVI?
------------

CURVI is a curvilinear search algorithm for small-scaled bound-constrained
minimization using no, first or first-and-second derivatives as available.

HOW DO I GET CURVI?
-----------------

CURVI was written and maintained by Hugo D. Scolnik

and others. It is available from

 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9lhkdugqau07cyw/AACN4g8HyWp47n8o18yLMyeka?dl=0

Extract into a suitable download director and rename all of the .FOR files
to be lower case and with a .f suffix, e.g.,

 mv RUT.FOR rut.f
 mv RUTF.FOR rutf.f
 mv RUTGH.FOR rutgh.f
 mv CURVIF.FOR curvif.f
 mv CURVIG.FOR curvig.f
 mv CURVIH.FOR curvih.f

NB. You may need to edit the files to change from DOS to Unix
end of line charachters, and to remove the  character at the
end of each file

CREATING THE OBJECT FILES FOR CURVI
-----------------------------------

Set the enviroment variable $CURVI to the root directory of the downloaded
package. To compile the required file, move to this directory and issue the
command

  gfortran -c rut.f rutf.f rutgh.f curvif.f curvig.f curvih.f

(substitute your required fortran compiler for gfortran). This will
produce the object files rut.o rutf.o rutgh.o curvif.o curvig.o and
curvih.o and  should reside in $CURVI or by preference in
$CUTEST/objects/(architecture)/(precision)/
for the architecture and precsion you intend to use.

USING THE CURVI INTERFACE TOOL
----------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The CURVI interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   CURVI.SPC     sets values for CURVI run-time parameters

If no CURVI.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default version
is copied from the $CUTEST/src/CURVI directory. This default contains the
following:

         2    DERIVS,  Derivatives available (<=0 none, 1 1st, >=2 1st and 2nd)
   1.0D+18    BIGINF,  Bounds larger than biginf in magnitude are infinite
   0.00001    EPS,     Stopping tolerance
         0    NF,      Maximum number of function evaluations (0 -> 1000*n)
         1    IDIFF,   Forward (<=1) or central (>=2) differences
         3    KMAX,    Hessian recomputation interval

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or
she wishes to modify these parameters.

To run with CUTEst, use the runcutest command with the -p curvi option.
See the man page for runcutest for more details of other options.
