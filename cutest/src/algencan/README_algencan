WHAT IS ALGENCAN?
----------------

ALGENCAN is an augmented Lagrangian code for large-scale constrained 
optimization that does not necessarily use matrix factorization.

HOW DO I GET ALGENCAN?
---------------------

ALGENCAN was written and maintained by J. M. Martínez

It is available from

CREATING THE OBJECT FILES FOR ALGENCAN
--------------------------------------

Set the enviroment variable $ALGENCAN to the root directory of
the downloaded package. Check the Makefile in $ALGENCAN
to see that variables are set appropriately for you. To compile the
required files, issue the command

  make algencan-cuter

and don't worry if you get messages about underfined CUTEr components;
they are not needed. 

Please make sure that the versions of 

  dim.par and hessdat.com 

in $CUTEST/src/algencan agree with those in the ALGENCAN distribution directory

  sources/algencan/

If not, import those from sources/algencan to $CUTEST/src/algencan, move
to the latter directory and issue the command

  make -s -f $CUTEST/makefiles/[your architecture]

where [your architecture] is the appropriate name from the list of files
in $CUTEST/makefiles

USING THE ALGENCAN INTERFACE TOOL
---------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The ALGENCAN interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   ALGENCAN.SPC     sets values for ALGENCAN run-time parameters

If no ALGENCAN.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTEST/src/ALGENCAN directory.

[Not used at present: This default file is as follows:

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or 
she wishes to modify these parameters. ]

To run with CUTEst, use the runcutest command with the -p algencan option.
See the man page for runcutest for more details of other options.
